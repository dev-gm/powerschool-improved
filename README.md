# powerschool-improved

## Features
- no extension needed
- auto-login

## TODO
- no need to run in already opened powerschool tab, can just click on bookmark and it will open powerschool for you
- insert script tag into homepage after logged in
- less clunky-feeling design
- new revamped grades ui
	- instead of "Grades and Attendance" tab in grades section, multiple tabs of years
- remove "Teacher Comments" and "Grade History"
- for "My Schedule":
	- show only one day at a time, default current day
	- include lunch time
	- scan daily post and show when teachers are absent (specifically do you need to go to class or not)
	- show actual names (not "last, first middle")
	- when you go back in time show which classes you were late/absent from
